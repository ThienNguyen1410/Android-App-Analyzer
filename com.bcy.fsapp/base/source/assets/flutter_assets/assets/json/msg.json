    {
      "q": "How does STEPN work?",
      "a": "Users can earn GST/GMT by walking, jogging, or running outdoors with an NFT Sneaker. Alternatively, users can choose to trade GST/GMT for other tokens through the in-app Swap function."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is GST?",
      "a": "GSTs are minted daily by users through moving. These GSTs are then burned daily to upgrade, mint new NFT Sneakers, etc."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is GMT?",
      "a": "GMT is the Governance Token of STEPN, users can spend GMT to access in-app features."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I need to transfer any SOL/BNB/ETH to use STEPN?",
      "a": "Yes, this is a Web 3.0 mobile app built on Solana and BNBChain. Users need to pay a SOL/BNB/ETH as Gas Fee when transferring digital assets."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can STEPN detect cheating?",
      "a": "We use motion sensors, GPS, and machine learning to detect cheating. This is explained in our white paper."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why didn't I earn anything after walking or running with STEPN?",
      "a": "There are many reasons you didn't make token earning; please make sure you are:\nMoving outdoors without overhead coverage (e.g., a tree or building);\nYou have Energy (e.g., 2.0/2.0 Energy);\nYou have allowed STEPN access to your GPS and Health data;\nYou have mobile data turned on and are not connected to Wi-Fi."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is \"Moonwalking\"?",
      "a": "Moonwalking occurs when you are not qualified for move2earn, which includes moving indoors, riding bikes, or driving cars, or have weak GPS signals. "
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the \"Minting\" function?",
      "a": "Users can mint a new NFT Sneaker from two Level 5 Sneakers by burning GST/GMT. Each Sneaker can be minted up to 7 times; the higher the minting count, the higher the cost, but also higher the chance to receive a \"twin\"."
    },
    {
      "q": "How can I refill my energy?",
      "a": "Your energy refills automatically at a rate of 25% every 6 hours."
    },
    {
      "q": "If my NFT Sneaker's Durability is 51/100, can I still run on it until it reaches 0?",
      "a": "Durability is a measure of how quickly an NFT Sneaker wears out. When the Sneaker Durability drops below 50% and 20%, the Sneaker receives a \"worn-out\" penalty, which reduces the Sneaker's Efficiency to 90% and 10% of its full value respectively."
